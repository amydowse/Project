TO BOOK AN APPOINTMENT

To make a blood clinic appointment you must enter the patients name. You should fill in as much information as possible but a name is the minimum.

Click into the area where you want to enter data, enter the data and press either the 'Enter' key or the 'Tab' key. Pressing 'Tab' will take you to the next column.

All of the appointments you enter will be saved when you click off of the screen - if there is either missing data or incorrect input, an error message will come up.


TO EDIT AN APPOINTMENT

Click into the area where you want to edit the data, enter the new data and press the 'Enter' key.


TO DELETE AN APPOINTMENT

Right click on the time of the appointment you want to delete and select 'Delete' from the menu.



TO MARK THE ATTENDANCE OF AN APPOINTMENT

On the column on the far left, click once - this turns the box next to it green to show that the patient attended. If you press it a second time, the box turns red to show that the patient did not attend. If you click it a third time, it becomes white to show that you do not know their attendance status.



If there is no blood clinic scheduled, you can create one in 'Settings'.
