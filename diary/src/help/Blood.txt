To make a blood clinic appointment you must enter the patients name. You should fill in as much information as possible but a name is the minimum.

Click into the area where you want to enter data, enter the data and press the 'Enter' key.

All of the appointments you enter will be saved when you click off of the screen - if there is either missing data or incorrect input, an error message will come up.


TO EDIT AN APPOINTMENT

Click into the area where you want to edit the data, enter the new data and press the 'Enter' key.


TO DELETE AN APPOINTMENT

Click into the 'Name' of the appointment you want to delete and delete the name. 

If you want to book another appointment into this slot, click the 'Blood Clinic' button on the left hand side - this will save that the original appointment has been deleted.


TO MARK THE ATTENDANCE OF AN APPOINTMENT

At the very left of the appointment, click once - this turns the box next to it green to show that the patient attended. If you press is a second time, the box turns red to show that the patient did not attend. If you click it a third time, it becomes white so show that you do not know their attendance status.



If there is no blood clinic scheduled, you can create one in 'Settings'.
