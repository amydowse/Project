USE

This is used to look for the appointments that a specific patient has.

You can look for just future appointments, just past appointments or both - you select this at the top of the screen.

You then enter the name, or part of the name, of the patient you are searching for. You can use any mixture of capital letters and lower case.

You do not need to know the full name - just any part of their first or last name.

You then press 'Search'.

A label will confirm the text that was being searched for.

The table will then show all of the appointments for patients that matched the search criteria.

This is a read only table - you cannot edit anything.
