USE

You can alter the times of a specific blood clinic that is already set up.



If you alter a blood clinic that already has bookings, these bookings will remain (even if the new times do not allow for that appointment time).



Select the date from the calendar and the current details will be shown - if there is no blood clinic on this day, this will be stated.

You can edit the details of the blood clinic.

The times must be a valid 24-hour time in the format of HH:mm


The start of the blood clinic must be before the end of the blood clinic.

The start of the break must be before the end of the break.

If you do not want any break in the clinic set the break start time and break end time the same as the clinic end time.


The duration of the blood clinic must be a number.


You must enter all of the details - nothing can be left blank.

When you have entered the details, press the 'Save' button.

If any of the values are not in the correct format, an error message will be displayed.
