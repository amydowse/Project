USE

This is used to set up a recurring template for the blood clinic.

Initially, it will display the current, active, template.


If you want to alter this, it will set up a new template from todays date going forward - the previous templates will no longer be used.


Select the days that you want the template to be set up for.

The times must be a valid 24-hour time in the format of HH:mm


The start of the blood clinic must be before the end of the blood clinic.

The start of the break must be before the end of the break.

If you do not want any break in the clinic set the breaks start time and break end time the same as the clinic end time.


The duration of the blood clinic must be a number.


You must enter all of the details - nothing can be left blank.

When you have entered the details, press the 'Save' button.

If any of the values are not in the correct format, an error message will be displayed.
